# Life-History-Galaxias-2025

My third chapter will explore the influence of energy allocated to growth on the baseline metabolism 
(standard metabolic rate or SMR) of juvenile fish. SMR is usually measured on fasted, postprandial, 
resting individuals, although in theoretical best practice it is also measured on a non-reproductive 
adult individual (no energy allocated to growth). 

Pulling together life history and metabolic data from three recent studies on *Galaxias maculatus*, 
I aim to study the relative influence of both growth and reproductive development on their baseline 
metabolism. I will also investigate the influence of temperature on any relationships between life
history traits and metabolism, assessing the potential influence of climate warming on fundamental
physiological trade-offs.
